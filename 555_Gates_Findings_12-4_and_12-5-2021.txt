555 Based Gates:

Highly recommend to use CMOS based 555s (e.g TLC555) for both speed and power savings. Bipolar should work, but will be slower and more power hungry.

Additionally going with a CMOS based 555 will result in higher resistances for the internal resistor ladder (which'll be important for some two input single 555 gate designs later that use the CONTROL pin as one of the inputs).

CMOS based 555s have internal resistor ladders of on the order of 100kOhm for each resistor approximately whereas BJT based 555s are closer to single digit (~5kOhm) for each resistor. Heck, you could even use a 555 as a wide tolerance resistor if needed.

Two Input Two 555s NOR Gate CMOS/NMOS Style:
	-CMOS Inputs
	-NMOS Style/Technology Output
	-Two 555s required
	-On each 555 tie their Threshold & Trigger pins together, this becomes an input. Thus a two input NOR gate for two 555s
	-Both RESETs must be tied to VCC.
	-Both CONTROL pins must be left floating or decoupled.
	-The output stage pull up can be anything as long as it respects the maximum current draw of the DISCHARGE pin (e.g. 150mA for CMOS based 555s on their DISCHARGE pin, at 5V this is a 33Ω resistor, recommend to be slightly higher at the minimum like a 47Ω. Of course for power savings, you should increase this resistor value whilst respecting the propagation time of the gate required).
	-Both DISCHARGE pins of each 555 will be the open drain NFETs that'll pull the pull up low.
	-Thus this is now a NMOS based NOR Gate
	-You still have each independent 555s OUTPUT pins, thus this NOR gate can also serve / provide two free CMOS Style/Technology Inverter outputs of each input.
